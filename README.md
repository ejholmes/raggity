# Station
At the moment, there are very few options for locally hosting and
serving git repositories. Many businesses don't want to host their
private repositories on a service like GitHub, and the cost for a
small business is prohibitive. The goal of Station is to fill this
gap; offering a powerful web interface to gitolite that can be hosted
within your own network.

Station is a Sinatra app for serving and browsing git repositores. It
is similar in nature to cgit, however it's far more than just a front
end.

Station is heavily influenced by [Github](http://github.com),
[Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite) and
[cgit](http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/).

## Installation
