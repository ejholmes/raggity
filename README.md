Station
=======
Station is a rails app for serving and browsing git repositores. It is similar in nature to cgit, however it's far more than just a front end. It uses gitolite as a backend for serving the repositories and manages the gitolite configuration automatically as you CRUD users and repositories.

At the moment, there are very few options for locally hosting and serving git repositories. Many businesses don't want to host their private repositories on a service like Github, and the cost for a small business is prohibitive. The goal of Station is to fill this gap; offering a powerful web interface to gitolite that can be hosted within your own network.

Station is heavily influenced by [Github](http://github.com), [Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite) and [cgit](http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/).
