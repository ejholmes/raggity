Station
=======
Station is a rails app for serving and browsing git repositores. It is similar in nature to cgit, however it's far more than just a front end. It uses gitolite as a backend for serving the repositories and manages the gitolite configuration automatically as you CRUD users and repositories.

Station is heavily influenced by [Github](http://github.com), [Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite) and [cgit](http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/).
